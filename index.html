                    Game Overview
                </h2>
                <p>Cricket is not just a game in India. It is a festival, a religion. It's a way of life, source of immense joy. The game of cricket was invented in England somewhere around 13th and 15th century. The first test match was played between Australia and England in 1877, Australia emerged victorious in that match. Two teams of 11 players each battle it out in the center of an oval shaped ground. The aim is scoring more runs than the opposition team, without losing all their wickets. Their is a bowler who bowls the ball. Two batsmen who score runs and run between the wickets, a wicketkeeper who stands behind the stumps and the rest of the bowling team fields trying to stop the flow of runs and take wickets to dismiss the oppositions team's batsmen. Their are various formats in cricket. Namely, test cricket which is the ultimate testing format of the game, testing ultimate skill, stamina, perseverance in the field. The other is ODIs or One Day Internationals which is of 50 overs each (each over has 6 balls), each team batting once. The third is the fast paced T20 format. This is the shortest format of the game, 20 overs each, making it a whirlwind of big hits and quick wickets. It is the most entertaining format of the game. Cricket is not just hard hitting the ball. It is a strategic mind game, which involves a lot of shot selection, field placement, fitness, mental strength, etc. There can be nerve wracking thrillers with last ball finishes, twists and turns, that keep you at the edge of your seat biting nails :D </p>
